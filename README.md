## What is VADE? 🤔
VADE (Van AD Express) is your local advertising partner on wheels. We turn our van into a moving billboard for your business, giving your brand visibility across the city. As we drive through high-traffic zones and park at prime spots, your business enjoys daily exposure to both commuters and pedestrians in neighborhoods that matter most to you.
